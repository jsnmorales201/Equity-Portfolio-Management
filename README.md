# Equity-Portfolio-Management
You will create a dataframe where there are 20 columns for the 10 stocks, each row is the "Close" and "Adj Close" prices for the 10 stocks on each day, in the order of the business days in 2018. Assume all buy/sell on the "Close" prices and there is no transaction cost.
